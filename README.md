# Drug-Classification
The goal of this project is to predict the type of drug a patient should be prescribed based on various medical attributes using a Decision Tree Classifier. The model is trained and evaluated on a dataset containing patient information such as age, sex, blood pressure levels, cholesterol levels, and sodium-to-potassium ratio.
